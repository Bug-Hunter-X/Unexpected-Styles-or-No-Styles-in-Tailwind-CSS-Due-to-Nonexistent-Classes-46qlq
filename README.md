# Unexpected Styles or No Styles in Tailwind CSS Due to Nonexistent Classes

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Tailwind CSS: using classes that don't exist in your configuration.  This can lead to unexpected styling behavior, often resulting in no visible changes or inconsistencies.

## The Problem

When you add a Tailwind CSS class to your HTML or JSX that isn't defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file (either directly or through a plugin), Tailwind won't apply any styles. This can be hard to debug, as there's no clear error message.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains examples of incorrect Tailwind classes.  The `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix it. 

## Solution

The solution involves double-checking your Tailwind CSS class names against the official documentation or your project's `tailwind.config.js` file.   Make sure you have the correct class name, including any prefixes or suffixes, like `bg-red-500`, `text-white` etc. Consider using a linter or IDE extension that flags potential issues with Tailwind classes for better early detection.
